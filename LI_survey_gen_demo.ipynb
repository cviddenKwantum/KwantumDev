We can represent each survey response as a vector by averaging the embeddings of the words in the response. After computing the cosine similarity between all pairs of survey responses, we can fill in the table of similarities. The diagonal values are all 1.000 because each survey response is identical to itself. The table shows that the survey responses are highly similar to each other as indicated by the high similarity scores (0.97-0.99) across all pairs of responses. This suggests that the consumers have similar perceptions of the brand LinkedIn and associate it with professional networking, job opportunities, personal branding, and career growth.\n"
